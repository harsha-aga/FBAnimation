This Swift code defines a simple iOS application that demonstrates an animation effect similar to Facebook's reaction animations. The main class, ViewController, handles the setup and user interactions, while the CurvedView class provides custom drawing functionality.

Main Components:
ViewController Class:

viewDidLoad(): Sets up a tap gesture recognizer to handle user taps.
handleTap(): Triggers the generation of multiple animated reactions when the view is tapped.
generateAnimatedFunction(): Creates an UIImageView with either a thumbs-up or heart image, and applies a keyframe animation to it, making it follow a custom path.
customPath() Function:

Generates a UIBezierPath that defines a curved animation path for the reactions to follow. This path includes control points to create smooth curves.
CurvedView Class:

draw(_:): Overrides the draw method to render the custom path on the view, useful for visualizing the animation path.
Features:
Custom Animation Path: Uses a Bézier curve for a smooth and visually appealing animation.
Randomized Attributes: Randomly selects the reaction type (thumbs-up or heart) and animation duration to add variability.
Gesture Recognition: Responds to user taps, creating an interactive experience.
